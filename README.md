ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m a beginner in the world of machine learning and AI, passionate about learning how to apply data and algorithms to solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m currently exploring various ML techniques, including supervised learning, regression, and classification, and Iâ€™m excited to deepen my knowledge by working on hands-on projects.

Iâ€™m learning Python and popular ML libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. Through personal projects, Iâ€™m gaining experience in building, training, and testing models, while continuously improving my skills.

My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with others, and develop a solid foundation in AI. Feel free to explore my repositories as I work on creating machine learning models and experimenting with different datasets. Letâ€™s connect and learn together!
